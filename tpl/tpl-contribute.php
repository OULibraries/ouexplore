                <p>As the soul of the university, we are the hub of knowledge creation at OU. We connect students and faculty with the resources, technology, and skills that cross disciplines and unify the campuses. We help the university to attract top students, to recruit and retain outstanding faculty, to continue to build world-class research collections, and to attract external funding needed to advance OU research.</p>
                <p>We invite you to invest in OU Libraries to give our scholars the tools to become champions and to forge the future fully prepared to take on the complex challenges we face as a society.</p>
